#monetizeG


A Next.js SaaS platform that enables open-source repositories to monetize through curated advertising placements in their README files. The webapp should feature: 
(1) GitHub App integration with OAuth authentication for automatic repository sync and README ad insertion using GitHub API webhooks, (2) An intelligent ad placement system using ML-powered content analysis to insert contextually relevant, non-intrusive ads with A/B testing capabilities, 
(3) A dual-dashboard interface - one for repository owners to configure ad preferences, view real-time analytics (impressions, CTR, revenue), and manage payouts via Stripe Connect, and another for advertisers to create campaigns, set targeting parameters (programming languages, repo popularity, geography), and track performance, 
(4) A sophisticated curation engine with AI-powered brand-repository matching, automated content filtering, and multi-tier approval workflows, 
(5) Revenue management with flexible models (CPM, CPC, revenue sharing), automated monthly payouts, and comprehensive analytics using PostgreSQL and Redis for data management, 
(6) Developer-friendly features including a CLI tool, configuration-as-code via .monetize.yml files, preview modes, and RESTful API access, 
(7) Advanced targeting and optimization using semantic analysis for advertiser-repository matching, dynamic pricing algorithms, and fraud detection, and 
(8) Integration with package registries (npm), CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions), and analytics tools, all built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel with microservices architecture for scalability
